# Class Clarity

## 🧠 Problem Statement
University students often struggle to create an optimized semester schedule that balances academic commitments, personal learning goals, and daily responsibilities. Moreover, finding like-minded peers with similar academic backgrounds and shared free time is difficult, which limits opportunities for collaboration and personal growth. There is a clear need for a smart, adaptive system that not only builds personalized schedules but also connects students meaningfully.

## 📱 App Introduction — Class Clarity
Class Clarity is an AI-powered scheduling tool designed to help university students plan their semester effectively. By inputting their current university courses, other courses of interest, and daily chores, students receive a personalized, generative AI-created semester schedule that balances workload and priorities.

One of the key features of Class Clarity is Guided Matching — it analyzes student schedules across the platform to match individuals with similar academic backgrounds (shared university courses) and overlapping free time slots. Based on mutual interests, the app suggests collaborative activities, study sessions, or peer learning opportunities to foster academic and social connections.

## 📌 Features
🧮 AI-Generated Schedules: Smart semester planning based on your real commitments and goals.

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Guided Matching: Discover peers with similar academic paths and aligned free time.

🎯 Interest-Based Activity Suggestions: Engage with students in meaningful, shared experiences.

🕒 Chore-Aware Planning: Includes daily responsibilities to create a realistic routine.

#### ⚠️ Important Notes
To get the best results, use course names that match the dummy data currently used by the system. The matching algorithm works best with the following course titles:

DSA, Discrete Math, Statistics, Psychology 101, Algorithms, Data Science, Economics, Operating Systems, Chemistry, English Literature, Sociology, Machine Learning, Philosophy, Physics I, Linear Algebra, Calculus II

You’re free to use other course names, but doing so may result in fewer or no matches during Guided Matching — since the sample data is currently focused on the list above.
